# Railway.toml - Root configuration for InstantTLS monorepo
#
# This is a monorepo with multiple services. Railway cannot automatically
# detect which service to deploy from the root.
#
# To deploy this application on Railway:
#
# 1. Create separate services for each app:
#    - API Service: Set root directory to "apps/api"
#    - Web Service: Set root directory to "apps/web"
#
# 2. See RAILWAY.md for complete deployment instructions
#
# Note: This file serves as documentation. Railway deployment must be 
# configured in the Railway dashboard by setting the root directory for
# each service.
